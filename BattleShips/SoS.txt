USER A THAT STARTS THE CHALLENGE
USER A does:
1 Button challenge on press -> method call(challenge), --> sentdata() with tag :playersearch -->

		Server does:
				method call(SearchPlayerandNotify) with parameter the name of the user to be called upon for game
				method SearchPlayerandNotify body{
					retrieves the value and the key of the user that are stored in a hashmap ,
					alse retrieves current clients USERNAME also to be displayed to the user as info
					ONCE it retrieves then:
					
					!!!	the readLine() blocking method is called for that threat in order !!!
					
it prints to the buffer( current threat) a requset with a tag :playerfound -->
method call (playerfound) that notifys the user and waits for a simple yes or no input
basically the server is saying back to the client that the player exists in the database
and a option dialog appears so that the user can confirm the action.

				IF the action = YES then: a new printwritter (in server) is called and prints to the outputStream of the user that the  A is calling 
						
				}
USER B THAT Recieves the challenge		
		USER B does:
				method call(challenge) --> Option dialog for input YES OR NO 
				IF input  = YES then:
								a new request with tag :findchallenger is sent to the Server with USERNAME that we said earlier,
								
								server does:
											method call(findChallenger) and retrieves the the Socket from the hashmap
											then a request tag:challengeAccepted is made and sent to a new printwriter with the socket of the client A
USER A does:
	method call(challengeAccepted) and simple displays a msg that the A accepted the request
